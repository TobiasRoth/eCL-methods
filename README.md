# A comparison of methods to estimate empirical critical loads from gradient studies
There are different methods to estimate empirical critical loads of Nitrogen deposition from gradient studies. Here, we apply four methods that were previously used to estimate empirical critical loads from gradient studies and apply them to two data sets.  

- **Atlantic Oak Forest (AOF):** The data are from the atlatic oak forest as presented in Wilkins et al. ([2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231016305350))
- **Mountain Hay Meadows (MHM):** The data are from the biodiversity monitoring in Switzerland ([BDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_Monitoring_Switzerland)). We selected the same sites as in Roth et al. ([2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167880913002375?via%3Dihub)) but used the most recent survey for each sites conducted between 2016-2020.
